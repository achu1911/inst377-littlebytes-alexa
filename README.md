# LittleBytes — Smart Ingredient-Based Meal Planning  
*A cozy Ratatouiller-inspired recipe app for college students*

LittleBytes is a meal-planning web app designed to help busy college students decide what to cook without wasting food or overspending.

Users can:
* Enter ingredients they already have
* Discover recipes thorugh our customer backend API
* View detailed step-by-step instructions
* Save favorite meals using a Supabase databse
* Browse saved recipes with a smooth, mobile-friendly carousel

I also chose to use the theme of Ratatouille and Paris, as the UI is intentionally soft and calming, which is meant to make cooking feel fun rather than stressful!
